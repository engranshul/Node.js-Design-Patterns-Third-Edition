// Most successful JS module systems are : asynchronous module definition(amd)
// popularized by RequireJs and later universal module defintion(umd)

// Node.js has two module systems: CommonJS modules and ECMAScript modules.

// Feeling is that ECMAScript modules is going to become the defacto way to
// manage javascript modules in both browser n server landscape

// JavaScript programs started off pretty small â€” most of its usage in the
// early days was to do isolated scripting tasks, providing a bit of 
// interactivity to your web pages where needed, so large scripts were
// generally not needed. Fast forward a few years and we now have complete 
// applications being run in browsers with a lot of JavaScript, as well as 
// JavaScript being used in other contexts (Node.js, for example).
